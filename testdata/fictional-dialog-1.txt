"Hey, what's going on today, how are you kids? Kids are good, Jack just got a new job as a firefighter. OH good for him. So what can I do for you. Well, I've got a list. OK hit me. I've got these spots. On your skin, yeah ok, on your forehead there. Okay. Was there any trauma to the skin? No, no, but any travel? I go to Mexico every year. Any history of skin cancer? Yes, I've seen a dermatologist for something that was over here and they've treated it with liquid nitrogen. Okay sure What else is going on? Well, you know, I've also noted that my hair has been thinning and I've been having some erectile dysfunction. How's your libido? No, libido has been good. Libido has been good, but just can't keep it up. OK there's a few things to consider... What else is going on? I need a refill of my high blood pressure medication. Any chest pain or shortness of breath? Nope. Are you exercising every day? Yeah. How about quitting smoking? No, I haven't quit smoking yet. Okay. On physical exam, the patient is not in acute distress. Can I check your heart... Cardiovascular and respiratory exam, unremarkable. Skin exam with two one centimeter scaling patches noted on the forehead, no pigmentation, no bleeding or ulceration. Okay. So we're going to send you to dermatology. I'm worried about actinic keratosis. What's that? It's a premalignant skin condition, so not cancer, but it can become cancer, so should be treated. I do see your blood pressure was good today. 125 over 80 will refill your amlodipine and Prindapril. And then regarding erectile dysfunction, honestly the biggest culprit is probably a combo if your age and the smoking, but we're going to get some blood work and I'll give you a prescription of sildenafil, excuse me, sildenafil. You have to try it a few times to know if it will work at this dose. It can cause headaches, or your blood pressure to drop, and you'll read on the warnings that if you get an erection that won't go away you need to go to the emergency room without delay. I want you to come back after the bloodwork is done so let's book a follow-up in one month."
